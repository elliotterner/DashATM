              <h2>Short Notice Installation</h2>
              <p>
              For the 6th year in a row, event planning has been <br /> 
              ranked as one of the most stressful jobs on earth. <br /> 
              That is why we are not surprised when we get last <br />
              minute event ATM requests. In fact, we prepare for <br /> 
              this. We keep our event ATMs ready to go at a moments <br /> 
              notice, so your customers will always have access to cash.

              <h2>Weatherproof</h2>
              <p>
              Operating out of Portland, Oregon, we understand what <br /> 
              itâ€™s like to suddenly deal with foul weather. This can <br />
              create serious problems when it comes to using an ATM <br /> 
              outdoors. We ensure this will not be an issue, and protect <br /> 
              our event ATMs from moisture and direct sunlight.

              <h2>Unlimited Vault Loading</h2>
              <p>
              Events are notorious for requiring exceptional amounts of <br />
              cash. In our experience, even small events often require <br />
              over $50,000 of cash on hand to keep ATMs filled. When you <br />
              request an event ATM through us, we guarantee unlimited vault <br /> 
              loading. While a variety of things can go wrong at an event, <br />
              running out of cash will not be one of them.
